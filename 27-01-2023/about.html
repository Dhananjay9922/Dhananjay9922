    <p>Welcome to Into The Creamy Cakes!
        I’m Dhananjay, and I have always been the world’s biggest fan of cakes  but it wasn’t until later in life that I found the joy in making <br>
        
        Baking cakes as a kid was fun, but with the attention span of a gnat it was hard to remain interested for more than a few <br>
        
        In 2020, my sister unearthed a snickerdoodle cake recipe I had always made with my babysitter as a child and I decided to give it a go (because nothing said let’s do some baking and eat all of our feelings like 2020)<br>
        
        From then, I was hooked. Not just on the eating of cookies, which is still very important to me, but on the fun you can have baking <br>
        Testing new recipes, figuring out that an egg yolk and egg are not the same thing (cringe) and learning to decorate with royal icing gave me something to keep me engaged in something new. </p></center><hr><br>
